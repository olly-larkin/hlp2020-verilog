# Individual Statement

## How will your code be used by the team (if all goes well) including what order are the modules in your team project compiled?  

My individual section is the parser that will construct an AST from the verilog source code. The AST will then be used to generate a netlist, which is used by 2 other individual sections. Because of this, my section will run first.

## Which part if any of your code is written for other people?

None.

## Which parts if any of your code is written by others?

None.

## What help have you obtained/given to others debugging or during code review?

LH in my group showed me a very neat way to organise the tests with helper functions which streamlined the writing of tests.

## How did you work out the types that interface your code with others?

We discussed it in a group setting and then discussed and made changes when we realised that there were redundancies or things needed to be added.
