# mp5617

Created simulator with `ng2517` and `oll16` for the team part
([`./team/Verishot/src/Simulator`](./team/Verishot/src/Simulator))

My individual contribution was the AST -> Netlist conversion
([`./team/Verishot/src/Netlist`](./team/Verishot/src/Netlist)). There was some
work on this section during the team part as well as we found a bug with the
way my netlist generator handled busses connected to built-in modules

`lh2617` deserves credit for developing the VSCode extension essentially by himself.
