# ARM Monaco Editor

> High Level Programming 2018 - Monaco Editor Starter Code

## Version

* v0.9 - pre-release

## Introduction

This is the skeleton code for the **EE3-22: High Level Programming** final project.
The target language is `F#`, which is transpiled to `Javascript` (`js`) thanks to [Fable](https://fable.io).
[Github Electron](https://electronjs.org/) is then used to convert the developed web-app to a cross-platform native application,
providing access to platform-level commands (i.e. file-system, path, multiple processes), which are unavailable to
(vanilla) browser web-apps.
[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) is the module bundler, responsible for the transpilation and automated building process.
Finally, [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) is used for as a self-contained javascript component that implements an editor window which your `F#` code can interact with.

## Dependencies

Before proceeding any further, make sure these packages are installed/setup to your machine:

1. [`dotnet core`](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/)

2. [`node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/): `Javascript` runtime engine

3. [`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install): `node.js` package manager

4. (**non-Windows only**) [`mono`](http://www.mono-project.com/docs/getting-started/install/)

5. [`fsharp`](http://fsharp.org/use/)

## Project Structure

### `package.json`

Electron bundles [Chromium](https://www.chromium.org/) (View) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Engine),
therefore as every `node.js` project, the `package.json` file specifies the module dependencies.
Additionally, the section `"scripts"`:

```json
{
    ...
    "scripts": {
        "start": "cd src/Main && dotnet fable webpack --port free -- -w --config webpack.config.js",
        "build": "cd src/Main && dotnet fable webpack --port free -- -p --config webpack.config.js",
        "launch": "electron ."
    },
    ...
}
```

is defining the in-project shortcut commands, therefore when we use `yarn run <stript_key>` is equivalent
to calling `<script_value>`. For example, in the root of the project, running in the terminal
`yarn run launch` is equivalent to running `electron .`.
Go on define your own shortcuts for commands that you use frequently
(not-necessary, but can automate development).

### `webpack.config.js`

`Webpack` configuration file, called when `yarn run start` is executed, firing a process that watches changes
to `src` folder files and transpiled the `F#` project to `js` on save.
For example, the `main.js` file is generated by:

```js
var mainConfig = Object.assign({
  target: "electron-main",
  entry: resolve("src/Main/Main.fsproj"),
  output: {
    path: resolve("."),
    filename: "main.js"
  }
}, basicConfig);
```

that selects the `F#` project at `src/Main/Main.fsproj`, transpiles it using `Fable` and saves the
generated `js` file at `main.js`.
The `rendered.js` file is generated similarly, using this configuration:

```js
var rendererConfig = Object.assign({
  target: "electron-renderer",
  devtool: "source-map",
  entry: resolve("src/Renderer/Renderer.fsproj"),
  output: {
    path: resolve("app/js"),
    filename: "renderer.js"
  }
}, basicConfig);
```

### `src` folder

#### `src/Main` and `main.js`

As already mentioned, Electron bundles `Chromium` and `node.js`.
`Chromium` uses a [multi-process architecture](https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/multi-process-architecture),
consisting of a **Main** and (at least) one **Renderer** process, where the main process is responsible for setting-up the windows
that the renderer process(es) use to for displaying their content, `html` & `js` files - web-app
(strictly speaking a main process can be run in a headless fashion, without any renderer process,
but it is out of the scope of this project).
The `src/Main/Main.fsproj` is a mini-project controlling the main process, which can be used **unchanged** throughout the project.

#### `src/Renderer` and `app/js/renderer.js`

The `Chromium` renderer process `F#` project.
Sets up callbacks and event-listeners for the DOM elements of `index.html`.
Use the documentation of each module to follow its logic.
> This project is incomplete, you are supposed to modify the code to customize the View (GUI) and link it with your emulator.

##### Access to `Emulator` project

You have access to your `Emulator` project by the namespace `Emulator` within the `Renderer` project,
see `src/Renderer/Renderer.fs` for an example:

```fsharp
open Emulator
/// Access to `Emulator` project
let foo = Emulator.Common.A
```

##### `Monaco Editor`

```fsharp
open Ref
open Update
/// Get code from editor
let code = Ref.code()
/// Set code to editor
Update.code("mov r7, #123")
```

#### `src/Emulator`

Your emulator source `F#` code. The development of this project can be done outside (i.e. Visual Studio) and then ported back to this
project (make sure that the project name and `.fsproj` file are preserved/updated because otherwise any dependency at
`src/Renderer/Renderer.fsproj` will brake and compilation will fail).

### `app` folder

The web-app, view, project files.

#### `app/index.html`

The markup code for the view.
`src/Renderer/Ref.fs` module accesses the elements defined in this DOM tree.
> Modify it for customizing the View.

#### `app/css`

`CSS` code to prettify your `index.html` elements.
The [PhotonKit](http://photonkit.com/) library is used by default, but feel free to replace it with any
other one you like, such as [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/), [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

#### `app/js`

The `js` scripts loaded by the `index.html`, **after** the DOM elements (statically defined) are rendered.

##### `app/js/editor.js`

`Monaco Editor` setup script.
> Modify it with care!!

## Getting Started

1. Fetch `npm` packages by executing `yarn install`

2. Restore `dotnet` packages by running `dotnet restore`

3. Compile `fsharp` code to `javascript` using `webpack` by executing `yarn run start`

4. Open `electron` application at a new terminal tab by running `yarn run launch`
