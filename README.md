`Verishot` is a Verilog Visualiser and Simulator that supports a subset of the Verilog language.

## Installation
There are two components in this application:
   * CLI: [`team/Verishot`](team/Verishot)
   * VSCode Extension: [`team/Verishot-Extension`](team/Verishot-Extension)

Installation guides are detailed in `README.md` files in both directories.

The VSCode Extension is optional but highly recommended as a development platform.
